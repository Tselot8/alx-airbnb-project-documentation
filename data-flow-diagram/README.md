# Airbnb Clone Data Flow Diagram

## Description
The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the Airbnb Clone project illustrates the flow of data between actors (Guest, Host, Admin) and system components, including databases (Account, Property, Booking, Review, Payment, Messages) and an external Payment Gateway. It depicts key processes such as user registration, property management, booking creation, payment processing, and review submission, highlighting data inputs (e.g., booking details, payment info) and outputs (e.g., booking confirmation, reports). The DFD ensures a clear representation of how data moves through the system, supporting efficient backend operations.
